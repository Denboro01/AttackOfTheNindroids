One-liner: Attack of the Nindroids is an auto-runner platformer where a lone ninja attempts to put an end to the robot invasion by heading to the headquarters of the robot manufacturer and shut them down.

Purpose: Attack of the Nindroids aims to be a mobile game that can be played by children at the age of 8-12 to distract them from their stressful surroundings (i.e. preparing for an operation).

Attack of the Nindroids is founded under the principles of what make mobile games amazing. I looked back into some of the best mobile games played by children (i.e. Jetpack Joyride, Fruit Ninja, etc.) along with console games played by children (i.e. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, etc.) to research and understand why children enjoy these games. In general, children enjoy video games due to the challenge they give to children to encourage them to think creatively and find out for themselves on how to solve their problems. Looking deeper into mobile games, the reason why children enjoy them is because they can be played in small bursts due to how short the levels usually are, the controls are extremely straight forward, and the games reward the child for winning.

For Attack of the Nindroids, the challenge I want to give to children is the challenge to beat levels as fast as possible. Being the fastest is a challenge that every child has faced. It's straight forward, easy to understand, and it's a great extrinsic motivator as children like to win.

The gameplay loop that I was aiming to achieve with Attack of the Nindroids is the following:
1) Game starts
2) Player moves
3) Jumps/crouches over obstacles
4) Fights off against robots
5) Reaches the end of the level
6) Proceeds to next level

Because the game was made in less than 48 hours, I could only focus on making one level which would serve as a tutorial level for the child on how the controls work. To not brutally punish the player on the tutorial level as that could cause them to be hesitant to try again, I had the level be designed in a way that even if the child misses the platform, they won't instantly lose. Instead, they'll be taken on a new path. While making the tutorial, I actually really love the idea of making levels that have branching paths to add a layer of replayability to them.

If I had extra time to work on this game, I would include the following additions:
1) Currency that the player can pick up in the levels that can be exchanged to change the clothes of the ninja
2) Include a level select screen
3) Add wind particles when the ninja is moving at top speed to improve the game feel of the movement
4) More levels, of course

Thank you so much for reading this, and I look forward to talking more soon!
